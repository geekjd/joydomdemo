**GameFi**

JOYDOM is a highly groundbreaking community-driven GameFi, which combines together NFTs, gaming, DeFi, and social networking. 
Players can complete in-game tasks, unlock various prizes, and freely build and personalize their own homestead.
In addition to socializing, cruising, adventuring, and fighting the monsters, they can also construct buildings, drive a car, fly an airplane, as well as planting, fishing, and petting.
JOYDOM warmly embraces everyone to come to be their own creator to play-to-earn together with creating and sharing in the community.

**Gaming, Owning and Creating**

Notice that all the objects you scavenge or collect in the game are indeed NFTs or fungible tokens on the blockchains.
To create NFTs, you will need to adventure across the exotic lands to grow plants, harvest, lumber, mine, fish, battle as well as collecting all the necessary materials in generating an NFT.  In other words, you will have to play-to-earn hard for them!
